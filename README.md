# M9: Casual Creator 

**Casual Constellations**

1. Brainstorm

Users casually create unique, personal constellations by linking stars together across the night sky. The program can be educational, fun, and (yes!) both. Students or anyone who wants to learn more about Astronomy can practice drawing famous constellations on the screen, like the Zodiac signs, Orion, or the Big Dipper, and search for patterns among the stars. Users can also have fun drawing their own constellations from scratch. People can use the same screen without relaunching the program over and over again because they have the chance to erase lines that they aren’t happy with. Someone could use the program to draw someone they love’s face among the stars or show friends how many real constellations they could recreate.

2. Personal Meaning

There are ~5 people other than your family who come along and change your life. Paul Trudelle, my seventh-grade Astronomy teacher, will forever be one of mine. In the summer after seventh grade, Mr. Trudelle lent me his small refractor telescope named “Tiny Timmy” and some high school textbooks. He also stayed in during lunch, recess, and after school all year to answer my questions, even though most of them were Google-able. That enthusiasm and encouragement made me learn more during summer camps throughout high school, build my own telescope from scratch, study Physics, conduct Cosmology research for two summers through the Center for Astrophysics after my freshman and sophomore years at Bowdoin, and pursue an eventual PhD or MsC. Learning the constellations was the first step towards understanding our small place amongst the stars and through my M9, hopefully, others will feel that inspiration. Even the small 500 x 500 screen filled with 1000 stars on Processing reminds us that we should keep looking up and stay curious. 

3. Challenge

M9 was an excellent refresher on Java. Data Structure has been my only Bowdoin CS course where we learned Java and we never explored visual applications. The lab was hard because the Processing language and IDE were brand new and that meant learning new methods, syntax, and program structure. Thankfully there were many examples provided online and on our class page. From the moment Professor Harmon wrote “A new kind of constellation?” as an example mission, that was my focus for the lab. Turning that concept into code was hard, but an excellent tutorial was available online where someone created stars. Using that and the Bubble example Professor Harmon provided, thinking about the code from an OOP approach made the most sense. From there, I searched and brainstormed different features like how to erase, draw continuous lines, and save progress. I’m sure I’ll use Processing down the line, and am thankful for the familiarity M9 brought.

4. Comfort Zone

Learning new programming languages and syntax has always been my hardest part of learning computer science. Even though the broad concepts are the same (loops, if-then statements, recursion, OOP), almost nothing makes me feel more helpless than knowing how my pseudocode should be implemented in Python and then feeling unable to translate them for Java or Ruby. This challenge proved that I’m able to learn and embrace new programming languages faster than anticipated and that you should make your vision come true even when you don’t know what the path to success looks like from the start. M9 forced me to embrace the unknown and spend hours playing with examples and watching tutorials. In the future, the program could be more dynamic, 3D, and realistic. Yes, there are mostly stars when you look up after the sun goes down, but there are also the faint whisps of the milky way, shooting stars, planets that don’t twinkle and have distinct outlines or hues most people can see from Earth with the naked eye, and nebula. Adding those features and movement would help make the scene more real.

[Animating Stars in Processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixD-sZ2tSu0&themeRefresh=1) combined with the Bubble example helped me think about an OOP approach to creating the Star background although that video goes much further into the star animation.
